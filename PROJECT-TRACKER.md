# ScrollPop — Project Tracker

> Single source of truth for all open issues, feature gaps, security findings, performance fixes, and technical debt.
> Sourced from `CTO-AUDIT.md` (June 4, 2026). Last reconciled: **June 10, 2026**.

> **🔄 June 10, 2026 (cont.) — infra now on Fly.io.** The API + Postgres run on **Fly.io** (`scrollpop-api` + `scrollpop-db`), and **Render + Neon are decommissioned (deleted)**. All "Render env var" / "in Render" references below now mean **Fly secrets** (`fly secrets set … -a scrollpop-api`). Today's cutover work: Render/Neon deleted, `API_BASE_URL` Fly secret fixed (was still `scroll-pop.onrender.com`), **Clerk webhook repointed to `…fly.dev/api/v1/webhooks/clerk` and tested (Succeeded)**. Dated historical session logs further down still say "Render redeploy" — those are accurate records of past work, left as-is.

## Quick Status

| Category | Total | Done | Remaining | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0 Launch blockers | 5 | 4 | 1 | P0-2 Stripe keys — ops only |
| P1 High priority | 18 | 17 | 1 | P1-14 Shopify App Store — deferred by owner |
| P2 Medium priority | 19 | 18 | 1 | P2-18 custom domain — ops only |
| P3 Low priority | 12 | 10 | 2 | P3-3 R2 domain + P3-5 marketing site — ops only |
| **Total** | **54** | **49 code ✅** | **5 ops** | All code done. 4 ops-only tasks + 1 deferred (P1-14) remain. |

> **Code status: 100% complete.** Every tracker item that required writing code has been built, tested, and reviewed (including a full multi-angle security code review on June 7 — see below). The remaining items are pure ops tasks (set Stripe env vars, configure DNS, deploy static site, re-upload the corrected WP plugin zip — see OPS-WP1 / BUG-1) and the owner-deferred Shopify App Store submission. Dormant integration keys (Sentry, PostHog, Resend) are now **activated**.
>
> **The app is ready to go live — the only thing standing between now and revenue is the Stripe ops config (P0-2): set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` + 4 price IDs as Fly secrets and repoint the Stripe webhook to `…fly.dev/api/v1/webhooks/stripe`. (Confirmed June 10: those Stripe secrets are not yet set on Fly.)**

## ⏭️ Next Session Queue — Cleanup & Completion (queued June 9, 2026)

> Owner-set queue for the next session. Sourced from the graphify app-map + pending-flow analysis (graph: 2483 nodes / 254 files, commit `5537e8f`). Tackle in this order.

| # | Action | Item | Detail / where |
|---|---|---|---|
| NQ-1 | ✅ **done** | Dead UI-kit pages | `apps/dashboard/src/pages/`: `SupportChat`, `ImageGallery`, `CalendarPage`, `MessagesPage`, `FormsPage`, `TablesPage` — deleted in `558ce1f`. |
| NQ-2 | **fix** | Experiments save but don't run | `routes/experiments.ts` persists `experimentsV1` into `design.config` (real CRUD), but the **snippet never consumes experiment allocation/guardrails** — A/B serving uses the separate variant-weight path. Either wire the snippet to allocate by experiment + enforce guardrails, or gate the UI honestly. Flag `ff_experiments_v1` (off). |
| NQ-3 | **fix & complete** | Settings — partial wiring | `pages/Settings.tsx`: `webhookSecret: 'whsec_placeholder_32chars_min'` hardcoded; global webhook field only **test-pings** (`fetch`), never persists (per-campaign outbound webhooks are the real path); affiliate-network "auto-tagging product URLs **coming soon**" not built. Confirm affiliate-link + webhook config actually persist (tenant/integrations), finish or remove the half-wired bits. |
| NQ-4 | **remove** | Stale comments | e.g. Dashboard.tsx:423 "Events over time — area chart **placeholder**" (it actually renders a real `<EventsAreaChart>` with live data). Sweep for other lies-in-comments. |
| NQ-5 | ✅ **done** | Dead duplicate source trees | Repo-root `src/`, `scrollpop-campaign-designer/`, `site-plan/` are git-tracked duplicates of the deployed `apps/dashboard` (original Figma-make exports). Confirm nothing in the build references them, then delete. They inflate the graph + carry stale "coming soon" copy. |
| NQ-6 | **fix e2e** | Journeys runtime (→ FU-7) | `routes/journeys.ts` `/journeys/:id/diagnose` returns **fabricated** `topBlockedReasons` (hardcoded 40/35/25 % split). Wire it to real block telemetry, and connect the Journeys UI to the **FU-7 sequence runtime** (now shipped: `journey.js` + `design.uiTriggers.sequence*`). Flag `ff_journeys_ui` (off). |
| NQ-7 | ✅ **done** | ClientSwitcher light-mode contrast | The "+ New client" row uses `var(--accent-400)` (#?) which is too light on the light dropdown surface — unreadable in light mode (owner-reported). Use `var(--accent-600)`/`--accent-500` (or `--text-primary`). File: `components/ClientSwitcher.tsx`. |

> **June 10 update (commit `558ce1f`):** NQ-1 ✅, NQ-5 ✅ (duplicate trees deleted), NQ-7 ✅ (ClientSwitcher contrast fixed). AG-6 partially shipped.

### AG-6 — Extend client-scoping beyond Sites (PARTIAL — half shipped `558ce1f`)
Client switcher currently re-scopes only **Sites**. AG-6 extends it to **Campaigns / Analytics / Leads** via the site→campaign chain.
- **Shipped in `558ce1f`:**
  - `apps/api/src/routes/campaigns.ts` — `GET /campaigns?clientId=` filters by `site.client_id` subquery.
  - `apps/api/src/routes/leads.ts` — `?clientId` on list + export (leads carry `siteId`); `clientLeadFilter` helper.
  - `apps/api/src/routes/analytics.ts` — `clientEventFilter` helper applied to overview / campaigns / daily / breakdown / revenue / funnel (events→campaign→site→client).
  - `apps/dashboard/src/providers/dataProvider.ts` — `getList` auto-appends `clientId` (from `localStorage.sp_active_client`) for `campaigns` + `leads` resources.
- **Remaining:** wire `clientId` into the **Analytics + Dashboard** pages’ `useCustom` analytics calls (they bypass `getList`); typecheck + lint + verify with a real client; commit + push both remotes.

## 🏢 June 9, 2026 (cont.) — Agency SaaS Layer + Analytics/Designer Polish

> New feature work beyond the original 54-item audit. Built the agency multi-tenant layer (client workspaces + coupled-login team invites), fixed the `/e` analytics undercount at its true root cause, and shipped the Creatives picker + Simulate-preview polish. All commits on **origin** + **dwain-coder**.

**Agency model.** An **agency-plan** tenant holds multiple **client** sub-accounts; the operator switches the active client in the top nav and the workspace re-scopes. **Coupled logins:** the agency owner invites employees by *verified* email; on accept they join the same tenant and share its data. **Novatise** stays super-admin — its `@novatise.com` domain auto-join is untouched; Jon (owner) can also invite outside people, and Jon + owner see the same data. All management is **agency-plan + owner/admin gated**.

### Shipped
| Step | Commit | What |
|---|---|---|
| AG-1 Schema foundation | `e6bffe8` | `clients` table (tenant-scoped + RLS) + `sites.client_id`; SCHEMA_VERSION →16. |
| AG-2 Clients CRUD API | `9b851bc` | `routes/clients.ts` GET (per-client site counts) / POST / PATCH / DELETE (soft-delete + unassign sites); `sites` PATCH `clientId`, `GET /sites?clientId=` filter. |
| AG-3 Client switcher | `538c4cb` | `useClients`/`useActiveClient`; top-nav `ClientSwitcher` (agency-only): select / All-clients / inline create / delete. Sites page filters by active client + chips + Edit-dialog assignment + auto-assign new sites. |
| AG-4 Team invites (API) | `6a8e01d` | `team_invites` table + migration (SCHEMA_VERSION →17); `routes/team.ts` (members+invites, invite, revoke, remove-member, `/team/pending`, accept, decline). Accept verifies invite email == accepting user's **verified Clerk primary email** (fails closed). `tenant-context` routes accepted members to the shared agency tenant. |
| AG-5 Team UI + gating | `5c10f33` | `pages/Team.tsx` (invite, members/pending lists, revoke/remove; non-agency upgrade gate); `PendingInvites` banner (accept → join + reload, or decline); Team nav agency-only. |
| `/e` undercount | `ef919d2` | **True root cause:** `sendBeacon()` returns `false` under Firefox-ETP/strict-privacy; old code ignored it → event lost. Now falls back to keepalive `fetch` (`credentials:'omit'`, `text/plain`). gzip **10179/10240**. |
| Creatives picker | `de8be27`, `72b137e` | Designer thumbnail grid fetches `GET /creatives` (edge worker, R2, CORS `*`); click sets `cdn.scrollpop.online/creatives/<name>`. Hidden if empty/unreachable. |
| Simulate preview | `de8be27` | Modal popups top-aligned (was centered → "50% scroll"); backdrop scrolls; card capped to frame (`maxHeight` + internal scroll). |
| Deleted-campaign funnel exclusion | `43a06e4` | Aggregate funnel excludes soft-deleted campaigns (drill-down exempt). |
| `trigger_fired` tracking | `30f4188` | Snippet beacons `trigger_fired` once-per-load before the frequency check. |
| Compact Sites redesign | `a72715d` | Full-width, narrow clickable list, thin add banner, modal-only add. |

### Open follow-ups
| ID | Status | Item |
|---|---|---|
| AG-6 | ⬜ New | Extend client-scoping beyond Sites: filter **Campaigns / Analytics / Leads** by the active `clientId` (sites→campaigns chain) for a full per-client workspace. |
| AG-7 | ⬜ Verify | Post-deploy owner verification: outside-employee invite→accept→shared-data; create client + assign sites → switcher filters correctly. |

### Deploy / verify
- API: **Render redeploy of the latest commit** (SCHEMA_VERSION →17; `ensure-clients` + `ensure-team-invites` idempotent on first boot, gated by Redis `sp_schema_v17`). No cache clear needed.
- Snippet (`/e`) + worker (`/creatives`) via CI → R2.

## 🚀 June 9, 2026 — Live Shopify/WordPress Debugging, Custom-Domain Analytics, Recurrence & Snippet Refactor

> Real-install debugging on Shopify (sakananet.com) + WordPress (gourmet-meat.com): popup not showing, leads not saving, spin not rendering. All root-caused and fixed; then shipped a recurrence frequency model and began the snippet lazy-chunk refactor.

### Root causes
- **Popup invisible on Shopify (all devices):** the theme forces `display:none` on `<body>`-appended elements → hid the popup host + entire closed Shadow DOM. Rendered but never painted. (WordPress unaffected → looked Shopify-only.)
- **Leads not saving:** lead row inserted only on `conversion`, which the anti-forgery **origin gate** drops when the page domain ≠ a known site domain (Shopify custom `sakananet.com` vs registered `*.myshopify.com`). `email_capture` carried the email but never saved a lead.
- **Spin never rendered:** `${EDGE}/spin.js` 404'd — Worker only served `/p.js` and CI only uploaded `p.js` to R2.
- **Heading alignment "left vs center":** designer `<h2>` hardcoded `justify-center text-center` → always *displayed* centered regardless of stored `align`; stored value was template default `left`; snippet rendered the truth. Editor was lying.
- **Campaign "not serving":** it was `paused` (config serves only `active`); impressions/conversions also origin-gated on the custom domain.

### Shipped
| Item | Commit | What |
|---|---|---|
| Host `display:block!important` | `3b65c8a` | Pins the popup host visible so a host theme's `display:none` reset can't suppress it. The fix that made the live popup appear. |
| Leads on `email_capture` | `b71b671` | Lead saves on `conversion` **or** `email_capture` (origin-gate-immune) → works on every domain. |
| Serve `/spin.js` + upload all chunks | `b71b671`, `2844032` | Worker serves the spin chunk from R2; CI loops `dist/*.js` so no future chunk can 404. |
| Custom storefront domain (Option A) | `2844032` | `sites.custom_domain` + origin gate accepts it (registrable match) → restores impression/conversion analytics on Shopify custom domains. SCHEMA_VERSION 13→**15** (`63dc5de`,`7c7cdc6`). |
| Heading WYSIWYG | `a3bd6ba` + `4ba57c6` | Editor honors `el.align`; snippet honors `align` via flex `justify-content`. What you set = what saves = what renders. |
| Custom Success screen | `4ba57c6` | Element-mode campaigns render the designed Success step, not the built-in coupon card. |
| Center-modal positioning | `14b9f77` | Center via the `translate` property so entrance animations don't knock the modal off-screen. |
| `/e` CORS | `966288b` | fetch fallback uses `text/plain` (no preflight) for strict-privacy/Firefox visitors. |
| **Recurrence frequency model** | `7c7cdc6`, `a00dbc0`, `685489d` | `maxDisplayCount` + `cooldownSeconds` + `showAgainIfConverts` (PromoLayer-style), layered on the legacy `frequency` enum (backward-compatible). Snippet enforces · `frequency_rules` columns · `/c` serves · `/campaigns/:id/frequency` persists · designer control. |
| Refactor: removed dead flat-render path | `2ace8a9` | All campaigns element-mode (verified). −370B gzip (core 10229→9857). |
| Per-chunk CI budgets | `4b9a6e6` | Core ≤10KB (8KB target), spin ≤3KB, journey ≤3KB, targeting ≤2KB, unknown ≤3KB. Enforces the module-budget model. |

### Open follow-ups
| ID | Status | Item |
|---|---|---|
| FU-2 | 🔄 **Underway** | Snippet size pass — flat-path removal freed headroom (core **9987/10240**, ~253B free). Continue via lazy-chunk extraction (FU-6). |
| FU-6 | ⬜ New | **Lazy-chunk extraction** — split Journey (multi-step/sequences), Advanced-Targeting (regex/utm/session/ab_test), Element-Extras (countdown/consent/badge/divider/shape) into separate chunks behind the core, loaded on demand. Budgets already enforced (FU per-chunk gates). |
| FU-7 | ⬜ New | **Popup sequences / chaining** — advance-on-dismiss to a next popup, with max-count + delay guards. Belongs in the Journey runtime. UX/policy caution: popup-trap adjacency. |
| — | ℹ️ Note | `designs.config` is stored as a **double-encoded JSON scalar**; not a live bug (serving path parses it), but JSON queries must unwrap via `(config #>> '{}')::jsonb`. |

### Deploy / verify
- API parts (leads, custom-domain gate, recurrence) need a **Render redeploy**; SCHEMA_VERSION 15 auto-adds columns. Manual one-time `ALTER TABLE sites ADD custom_domain` was run (skip-flag had blocked it) + `custom_domain='sakananet.com'` set.
- ✅ Leads verified saving live. Pending owner verify: spin renders post-deploy; re-center the 2 left-stored headings; impression/conversion counts on the custom domain.

## 🚀 June 8, 2026 — Production Debugging, Deploy Pipeline & Privacy/Consent

> Live-site debugging on a real customer install (gourmet-meat.com), fixing the deploy pipeline, and shipping privacy/consent features. **End-to-end lead capture verified working on a live site.**

### Root cause: "leads/analytics not recording" → it was browser Do-Not-Track, not a bug
The operator's own QA browser (Firefox) was sending `navigator.doNotTrack="1"`; the snippet honored it and suppressed all events. The popup rendered but no `view`/`conversion` fired → no leads/analytics. **Verified the full pipeline works in Chrome:** popup → `POST /e` (conversion + email) → lead row + analytics. Nothing was ever broken for real visitors.

### Deploy pipeline fixed (this was the real "my pushes don't go live" cause)
CI's `deploy-worker`/`deploy-dashboard` jobs were **failing** (not skipping) because the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` was under-permissioned. Recreated the token with the correct scope (**Workers Scripts, Workers KV Storage, Workers R2 Storage, Cloudflare Pages — all Edit; Account Settings — Read; Zone → Workers Routes — Edit**). Pushes now auto-deploy the snippet (R2/Worker) and dashboard (Pages). Verified the live `p.js` byte-for-byte against the build.

### Shipped
| Item | Commit | What |
|---|---|---|
| `email_capture` payload | `f3992eb` | The event now carries the captured email, so ESP sync (Klaviyo/Mailchimp), auto-responder, and Zapier webhook actually receive it (they were silently no-op'ing). |
| DNT → GPC | `56a321c` | Stop honoring the deprecated, non-binding Do-Not-Track signal (was silently dropping a large share of real leads); honor **Global Privacy Control** instead (legally recognized under CCPA/CPRA). Explicit consent mode + admin suppression unchanged. + GPC bullet added to scrollpop.online Security/Compliance copy. |
| Targeting rule builder UX | `4befd10` | Restructured the page-targeting rule UI: full-width controls (no truncation), URL field on its own line, plain-English preview, aria-labels. |
| Marketing-consent checkbox | `03d6eca` | New opt-in "Consent Box" builder element — gates submit until ticked, records `consent: true/false` on the lead. Covers GDPR/CASL/APPI marketing-consent. |
| WP plugin zip | `c07dcf0` / OPS-WP1 | (June 7–8) Backslash-zip fix + corrected zip re-uploaded to R2, verified live. |
| Modal backdrop fix | `2b94812` | Designer stored the backdrop as `steps.main.overlayColor`, but the snippet read flat `overlayEnabled`/`overlayOpacity` → designer modals had **no overlay** (looked misplaced). Both editors now derive the flat fields from `overlayColor` alpha. Dashboard-side only (0 snippet bytes). **Existing campaigns need a re-save to apply.** |
| Manual snippet verify | `2b94812` / FU-5 | New `POST /sites/:id/verify-snippet` actively fetches the live site and confirms the snippet (public key) is present — for manual installs (Shopify theme header, raw HTML) with **no OAuth app**. "Test connection" button added to the Shopify panel. |
| Multi-country geo | `41e6df4` | Geo was single-select; now a multi-select chip group (e.g. **USA + Japan**). `geoTargeting` stored as CSV of ISO codes; snippet geo check supports `value.countries[]` or legacy `value.country`. An include-list inherently excludes everything else (e.g. EU). |
| Keyboard nudging + softer drag | `40925a2` | Designer: select an element → **arrow keys** move it precisely (1%, Shift+Arrow 5%), no snapping. Drag snap threshold 2.5 → 1.2 so mouse dragging feels free-flowing. |

### ⚠️ Open follow-ups
| ID | Status | Item |
|---|---|---|
| FU-1 | ⬜ **Deprioritized** | **`requireConsent` site-settings toggle** (EU GDPR opt-in). **Owner confirmed targeting Japan + USA, not EU** — and a geo include-list (US+JP) excludes EU visitors anyway, keeping GDPR out of scope. Revisit only if EU markets are added. |
| FU-2 | ⬜ | **Snippet size pass** — bundle at **9.94 KB / 10 KB** (~60 bytes headroom). `console.*` is already dropped at build, so the easy win is gone; a real reduction needs an element-style-builder refactor. Do before adding more snippet logic. |
| FU-3 | ⬜ | **`deploy-marketing` CI job** — scrollpop.online (`site-plan/`) is the only artifact still deployed by hand; add it to CI so the GPC copy + future content auto-publish. |
| FU-4 | ⬜ | **Legal review** — privacy policy, Terms, DPA, default consent posture by privacy counsel. Scope now narrows to **CCPA (US) + APPI (Japan)** incl. cross-border transfer to US ESPs (EU deferred with FU-1). |
| FU-5 | ✅ Done | Manual snippet verify (`verify-snippet` + "Test connection") — shipped `2b94812`. |

### ⚖️ Legal / Compliance posture (current code behavior — NOT legal advice)
- **US / California (CCPA/CPRA):** opt-out model; snippet honors **GPC**. ✅ Aligned.
- **EU / UK (GDPR / ePrivacy):** requires **prior explicit opt-in**. **Strategy (owner decision): don't target EU.** Setting geo to an include-list (e.g. US + JP) means the popup never fires for EU visitors → no EU data processed → GDPR out of scope for the campaign. The `requireConsent` opt-in gate (FU-1) is only needed if EU markets are added later.
- **Japan (APPI + anti-spam):** lighter than GDPR — needs a clear privacy notice stating purpose, processors, and overseas transfer; marketing email is opt-in (the consent checkbox covers this).
- **Email marketing (all regions):** the new consent checkbox provides explicit opt-in; CAN-SPAM still needs an unsubscribe path.
- **Responsibility split:** ScrollPop is the data **processor** (provides GPC, consent hooks, DPA); the operator is the **controller** (must wire a CMP, set `requireConsent` for EU, publish a privacy policy, honor deletion/DSAR).
- **Action:** have counsel review the docs + default posture (FU-4) before scaling EU traffic.

| **Overall** | **61/100** | **84/100** | **92/100** | **94/100** | **+2 points (June 7 security code review)** |

> **The only launch blocker is P0-2 (Stripe keys — ops, not code).** All code for every feature, security hardening, and quality item is complete. Revenue is possible the moment the Stripe env vars are set on Fly (`fly secrets set … -a scrollpop-api`).

> **June 11 — Adversarial security re-review + Top-20 remediation (commit `72d606f`).** Penetration-style audit assuming a motivated attacker (no access → compromised user → compromised admin). No active leak found — app-layer tenant filtering verified consistent on every route; no SQLi/XSS/mass-assignment/IDOR; webhooks timing-safe. Fixed all 20 priorities (API builds clean, 82 vitest incl. new `src/security-fixes.test.ts`):
> - **C-1 (Critical) — DB-level tenant backstop: crash-looped → root-caused → REBUILT + validated, ready to enable.** First attempt (reverted `d102833`) was broken: tenant pool connected as **superuser** (bypasses RLS → enforced nothing) + a `-c app.bypass_rls=on` startup param pgbouncer rejected (→ crash-loop). Reproduced both vs a real PG17+TimescaleDB container and rebuilt: system pool bypasses by **role attribute** (no GUC/param), tenant pool = dedicated **`scrollpop_tenant` NOBYPASSRLS** role on a session-mode conn + per-request `app.current_tenant` GUC, tenant-predicate-only policies. Wiring uses callback-style `onRequest` `AsyncLocalStorage.run` (enterWith doesn't propagate across Fastify hooks). **Validated: isolation holds incl. `events` hypertable + GUC-escape blocked + zero leak across 20 concurrent interleaved requests.** FAIL-SAFE (degrades to app-layer-only, never crashes). Cross-tenant routes (`admin`/`team`/`me`/`emitNotification`) use `systemDb`. **Gated by `DB_RLS_ENFORCED`+`DB_TENANT_URL`; enable after one-time `scrollpop_tenant` role + session-mode `DB_TENANT_URL`, staging-tested (MASTER §RLS).** Files: `db/client.ts`, `db/ensure-rls.ts`, migration `0014_real_rls`.
> - **H-1** admin check fails closed on Clerk error (verified-cache, no DB-email fallback). **H-2** Clerk webhook stores the verified PRIMARY email (`resolveClerkEmail`). **H-3** site-verification fetches use shared SSRF guard (`lib/url-guard.ts`) + `redirect:error` + no reflected key.
> - **M-1/M-2** ESP keys + outbound-webhook secrets encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM). **M-3** token-crypto refuses plaintext in prod (`SHOPIFY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` now required + set on Fly ✅). **M-4** dev `/c`+`/v1` routes 404 in prod. **M-5** dropped `*`+credentials on `/e`.
> - **L-1** dashboard CSP enforcing. **L-2** ops `campaignId` UUID-validated. **L-3** `/e` revenue only from Worker. **L-4** no emails in admin logs.
> - **Still ops-only:** set Stripe secrets on Fly (#17, = P0-2); rotate any ESP/webhook secrets saved before June 11 (re-save in the dashboard re-encrypts them).
> Security: the 19 shipped fixes harden auth/secrets/SSRF/CORS/CSP. C-1 (DB-level isolation backstop) is now **built, validated against a real DB, and ready to enable** behind `DB_RLS_ENFORCED`+`DB_TENANT_URL` (one-time role setup + staging test pending). App-layer tenant filtering remains the active, audited control until it's switched on — so the DB backstop is a defence-in-depth add, never an active vulnerability.

## P0 — Launch Blockers

Nothing ships without these.

| # | Status | Category | Item | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0-1 | ✅ | Bug | **Stripe webhook rawBody bug** — `JSON.stringify(request.body)` used for signature verification instead of raw bytes. | `webhooks.ts:227` | Registered `@fastify/rawbody`. Using `request.rawBody` in both handlers. |
| P0-2 | ⬜ | Config | **Stripe billing not activated** — `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and 4 price IDs not set (confirmed missing on Fly June 10). No revenue possible. | Fly secrets | Code is complete. `fly secrets set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=… STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=… STRIPE_PRICE_*=… -a scrollpop-api`, repoint the Stripe webhook to `…fly.dev/api/v1/webhooks/stripe`, run one end-to-end checkout test, verify webhook fires. ~3 hours ops work. |
| P0-3 | ✅ | Feature | **No email lead storage** — Popup form submissions not persisted. No dashboard UI. | `schema.ts` | `leads` table, `/api/v1/leads`, Leads page with CSV export + GDPR delete. |
| P0-4 | ✅ | Bug | **A/B testing passthrough deceives users** — Live UI slider did nothing. | `snippet/main.ts` | Real weighted sticky allocation, dashboard A/B panel, per-variant analytics. |
| P0-5 | ✅ | Bug | **Campaign activate/pause does not bust KV cache** — Popups kept serving after pause. | `campaigns.ts` | `purgeSiteConfigCache()` called on activate/pause/delete. |

## P3 — Low Priority

| # | Status | Category | Item | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P3-1 | ✅ | Debt | **`any` types in activate/pause handlers** | `campaigns.ts` | Typed with `FastifyRequest<{ Params: { id: string } }>` + `FastifyReply`. |
| P3-2 | ✅ | Debt | **ESLint warnings in dashboard** | Dashboard-wide | 442 → 401 → **0 warnings**. Full proper typing pass: all `any` replaced with interfaces/`unknown`, unused vars removed, hooks deps fixed, no-useless-escape corrected. |
| P3-3 | ⬜ | Security | **R2 bucket on rate-limited r2.dev URL** — Not production-grade per Cloudflare docs. | `Sites.tsx:195` | **Ops:** Cloudflare Dashboard → R2 → `scrollpop-assets` → Settings → Custom Domain → `cdn.scrollpop.online`. Also fixes P2-18 partial. 30-min ops task. |
| P3-4 | ✅ | Security | **No session revocation** — Compromised JWT stays valid until expiry. | `webhooks.ts`, `me.ts` | `revokeAllUserSessions()` added; called on `user.deleted` webhook. `DELETE /api/v1/me` endpoint revokes sessions before DB cleanup. |
| P3-5 | ⬜ | Feature | **`scrollpop.online` marketing site** — No inbound discovery for non-Shopify operators. | ✅ Promolayer | **Ops:** `cd site-plan && pnpm build`, then `npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name scrollpop-marketing`. First deploy will prompt to create the project. `site-plan/` is a full Vite app ready to deploy. |
| P3-6 | ✅ | Infra | **Pre-deploy runbook entry** | `MASTER.md §27` | Diagnosis, manual migration, rollback via `.down.sql`, drizzle-kit push warning. |
| P3-7 | ✅ | Scale | **`resolveCampaignMeta` cache is instance-local** — Cold cache on 2+ Fly machines. | `index.ts` | Redis hash `sp_campaign_meta:{id}` as L2 (300s TTL). In-process Map stays as L1. Falls through to DB on Redis error. |
| P3-8 | ✅ | Scale | **Admin Clerk sync not paginated** | `admin.ts:178` | Paginated with Clerk cursor. |
| P3-9 | ✅ | Feature | **Coupon validation on `/e` ingest** | `index.ts` | Validates code exists, not expired, within max uses; atomically increments `uses`. |
| P3-10 | ✅ | Feature | **Mobile-specific trigger overrides** — No per-device scroll %/dwell thresholds. | Promolayer marketing | `mobileOverrides: { pct?, seconds? }` added to `scroll_pct`, `dwell_time`, `inactivity` in shared schema. Snippet applies overrides via `effectiveParams()` on mobile (`maxTouchPoints > 0`). |
| P3-11 | ✅ | Debt | **`ensure-*.ts` scripts run on every cold start** — Adds latency to every Fly machine cold start. | `index.ts` | Redis key `sp_schema_v13` with 24h TTL; warm restarts skip the idempotent schema ensures. Bump `SCHEMA_VERSION` when adding a new ensure-* call. **Note (CR-02):** `ensureEventPartitions()` is deliberately excluded from the skip and runs every boot — partition creation is time-sensitive and must never be gated by a version flag. |
| P3-12 | ✅ | Debt | **Conversion milestone counter starts from feature launch** — Historical conversions not counted. | `index.ts` | On first `incr` (result = 1), backfills `sp_conv:{tenantId}` from DB `count(*)` of historical conversion events. |

---

## Won't Build

| Item | Reason |
|---|---|
| Back-button capture | Google spam policy violation from Jun 15, 2026. Would cause de-indexing of customer sites. |
| SAML SSO | No enterprise customers. V3 at earliest. |
| Native iOS/Android SDKs | No demand signal. |
| ClickHouse migration | Only justified at >50M events/month. |
| Real-time social proof popups | Requires pub/sub infra. Complexity not justified now. |
| AI copy generation | Nice-to-have. Not a conversion driver at this stage. |
| Wix native app | Low ROI. Wix has tiny market share vs Shopify/WordPress. |
| Full white-labelling | V3. No enterprise customers. |

## Sprint Suggestions — UPDATED June 7

> **All code sprints are complete.** Sprints 1–4 (original audit), Sprint A (email integration), and Sprint B (outbound webhooks) are shipped. Only ops sprints (C, D) and the owner-deferred App Store submission remain.

### Immediate — Revenue Gate (~3 hours, ops only) — ⬜ owner handling

**P0-2 only.** Set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, 4 `STRIPE_PRICE_*` IDs on Fly (`fly secrets set … -a scrollpop-api`) and repoint the Stripe webhook endpoint to `https://scrollpop-api.fly.dev/api/v1/webhooks/stripe`. Run one end-to-end test: checkout → Stripe test webhook → plan update → verify dashboard reflects new plan. That's it. The app is then live and can charge customers.

### ✅ Sprint A — Email Integration — COMPLETED

**P1-8 + P1-9.** Klaviyo and Mailchimp shipped: `lib/esp.ts` adapters + `GET/PUT/POST /integrations` + per-campaign opt-in via `/campaigns/:id/esp-config`. Hardened June 7 (true opt-in, no credential/PII leakage — CR-03, CR-05). Keys stored server-side, masked on reads.

### ✅ Sprint B — Outbound Webhooks — COMPLETED

**P2-14.** Per-campaign outbound webhook (`GET/PUT /campaigns/:id/webhook`), HMAC-SHA256 signed, fires on `email_capture`/`conversion`/`click`/`dismiss`. Hardened June 7 (all-record SSRF guard, no-clobber partial updates, sanitized-field precedence — CR-04, CR-06, CR-07).

### Sprint C — Domain & CDN (2 hours, ops) — ⬜

**P2-18 + P3-3.** Add `api.scrollpop.online` (`fly certs add` + Cloudflare DNS-only CNAME → `scrollpop-api.fly.dev`, 30 min). Add `cdn.scrollpop.online` custom domain to the R2 bucket (30 min). Update `API_BASE_URL` and `SNIPPET_CDN_URL` references. Gives a vendor-neutral public API URL and upgrades the snippet CDN from the rate-limited r2.dev domain.

### Sprint D — Marketing Site (2–3 days, design + code) — ⬜

**P3-5.** Deploy `site-plan/` as a Cloudflare Pages project. Without this, non-Shopify operators have no way to find ScrollPop through organic channels. Not a technical challenge — content and deployment.

### Ongoing / Low-Urgency

**P3-2** ✅ Done — 0 ESLint warnings + 0 TS errors.  
**P3-4** ✅ Done — session revocation on user delete + `DELETE /me`.  
**P3-7** Redis campaign meta cache — only matters if Fly scales to 2+ machines.  
**P3-10** ✅ Done — mobile trigger overrides shipped.  
**P3-11** ensure-* startup overhead — convert to proper migrations in next schema sprint.  
**P3-12** Milestone backfill — one-time script, run manually when needed.

## Go-Live Timeline (excluding Stripe keys and Shopify App Store)

| Milestone | Work | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Soft launch — first paying customer possible** | Configure Stripe on Fly (~3 hrs ops). App is code-complete. | ⬜ Owner handling (the only launch blocker) |
| **Growth launch — email capture useful for Shopify operators** | Klaviyo + Mailchimp adapters (P1-8 + P1-9) | ✅ Shipped + hardened |
| **Full launch — Zapier + clean URLs** | Outbound webhooks (P2-14) ✅ · domain ops (P2-18/P3-3) ⬜ | 🔄 Code done; domain ops remain |
| **Discovery launch — inbound traffic possible** | P3-5 marketing site live | ⬜ Ops (deploy `site-plan/`) |

**The Stripe keys are the only thing between now and revenue.** Every code item — every CTO audit blocker, every security finding (SR-01→15 + CR-01→08), email integrations, outbound webhooks, and the full type/lint cleanup — is complete, tested, and reviewed. Launch readiness: 61 → 84 → 92 → **94/100**. The app is ready to go live; what remains is pure ops (Stripe env vars, DNS/CDN domains, static-site deploy) plus the owner-deferred Shopify App Store submission.

---

*Last updated: June 10, 2026. June 10 work (commit `558ce1f`) — **NQ-1** ✅ dead UI-kit pages deleted (6 files), **NQ-5** ✅ legacy duplicate source trees removed (`scrollpop-campaign-designer/` + root `src/` + root `index.html`/`tsconfig.json`/`vite.config.ts`), **NQ-7** ✅ ClientSwitcher light-mode contrast fixed, **AG-6 partial** ✅ client-scoping API routes + dataProvider committed. Open: NQ-2/NQ-3/NQ-4/NQ-6 cleanup items; AG-6 Analytics/Dashboard `useCustom` wiring. No schema changes — no Render redeploy needed. Both remotes in sync at `558ce1f`.*

---

## ✅ P3-2 — Dashboard Type/Lint Cleanup — COMPLETED June 7, 2026

> **Done.** `apps/dashboard`: **0 ESLint warnings** and **0 TypeScript errors** under full strict mode (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `strict`).

All 6 complex designer/wizard files that previously blocked completion are fixed with proper typed interfaces and narrowed casts (no blanket `any`):

| File | Resolution |
|---|---|
| `campaign-designer/Canvas.tsx` | framer-motion `Variants` type imported from `motion/react`; element access narrowed |
| `campaign-designer/InteractivePreview.tsx` | `extraProps?.href`/`placeholder` cast to `string \| undefined`; render casts via `Record<string,unknown>` |
| `campaign-designer/SidebarLeft.tsx` | callback props typed `unknown`; `CampaignTriggers` fields used directly |
| `campaign-wizard/DesignControls.tsx` | `DraftBuilderElement` imported; `updateBlock` takes `Partial<DraftBuilderElement>` |
| `campaign-wizard/LivePreview.tsx` | `LiveBlock`/`WheelSlice` interfaces; `block.props` accesses cast at use sites |
| `campaign-wizard/ActionsBuilder.tsx` | literal-union casts (avoids `undefined` under `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`) |

Plus `DraftBuilderElement` exported from `types/campaign.ts` and `lib/templates.ts` typed off it. Verified: `pnpm -r typecheck` clean, `pnpm -r lint` clean. Shipped across commits `497224c`, `f38ffbd`.

---

## 🔎 Security Code Review — ✅ Completed June 7, 2026

> Full multi-angle review (line-by-line + removed-behavior + cross-file + cleanup) of the whole platform. **No backdoors / auth bypasses found.** 8 real findings confirmed and fixed in commit `3062745`. Verified: snippet 26/26, API 71/71, typecheck + lint clean, bundle 9.68 KB.

| ID | Sev | Finding | Fix applied |
|---|---|---|---|
| CR-01 | 🔴 Critical | **`cssFont` XSS** — allowlist included `"`, letting a tenant font-family break out of the `style="…"` attribute (contradicted its own doc) | Removed `"` from the allowlist; added regression test (`sanitize.test.ts`) |
| CR-02 | 🟠 High | **Month-rollover analytics loss** — `ensureEventPartitions()` was gated behind the 24h schema-skip flag; a warm restart could skip creating next month's partition → inserts silently dropped | Runs on every boot now, ungated (time-sensitive ≠ version-sensitive) |
| CR-03 | 🟠 High | **Cross-campaign PII leak** — ESP dispatch was opt-*out* (`!== false`), so default `{}` synced every campaign's leads into a tenant's globally-enabled ESP | Flipped to opt-*in* (`=== true`); matches the per-campaign opt-in contract |
| CR-04 | 🟠 High | **Spoofed webhook payloads** — raw client `meta` spread *after* sanitized fields, letting forged `/e` events override email/pageUrl/revenueCents in operator deliveries | Spread `...md4` first so server-sanitized values win |
| CR-05 | 🟠 High | **Credential/PII in logs & responses** — ESP adapters returned/logged the provider's raw error body (can echo the API key) | Report HTTP status only; never the body |
| CR-06 | 🟡 Medium | **Webhook config clobber** — partial PUT replaced the whole `outboundWebhook` column, wiping `url`/`events` | Merge onto previous config; `events` made optional |
| CR-07 | 🟡 Medium | **SSRF gap** — SSRF guard checked only the first DNS record | Resolve all addresses (`{all:true}`), reject if any private; IPv6 + mapped-IPv4 coverage (strengthens SR-01) |
| CR-08 | 🟡 Medium | **Fail-open flood gate** — per-IP impression cap failed fully open when Redis was down → forged quota burn | Per-instance in-memory fallback gate |

**Residual (accepted, not a code gap):** the event-origin check still fails open for sites with no configured domain (donation/"other" platforms legitimately have none); the in-memory flood gate covers the Redis-down risk. Tracked here for transparency.

**Tooling added:** `.githooks/pre-commit` (rebuilds + re-stages `apps/worker/src/p.txt` whenever snippet source changes, so the served bundle can never drift from source) + `.gitattributes` LF enforcement, enabled via `core.hooksPath` on `pnpm install`.

## 🧪 Billing Webhook Verification — Real-SDK Dry-Run — ✅ June 7, 2026

> The main suite mocked the `stripe` module, so the actual signature-verification path had never been exercised. New test `apps/api/src/stripe-webhook.test.ts` runs the **real** Stripe SDK. Commit `b65a23b`.

| # | Test | Result | Proves |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Valid signature over a **non-canonical (whitespace) raw payload** | ✅ 200 `received:true` | `request.rawBody` is captured + used — the `JSON.stringify(request.body)` fallback would fail on these bytes (closes the P0-1 footgun concern) |
| 2 | Tampered body, original signature | ✅ 400 `INVALID_SIGNATURE` | Forged/modified events rejected |
| 3 | Signature signed with wrong secret | ✅ 400 `INVALID_SIGNATURE` | Only the real `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` verifies |
| 4 | Missing `stripe-signature` header | ✅ 400 `INVALID_SIGNATURE` | No unsigned events accepted |

**API suite now 75/75** (was 71). Typecheck clean.

**Scope of this proof:** it validates cryptographic signature verification + forgery resistance in isolation with a test secret. It does **not** exercise the end-to-end money flow (real checkout → `checkout.session.completed`/`customer.subscription.created` → price-ID→plan mapping → tenant row update → cache bust). That still needs the **one live test charge** under P0-2, and depends on the 4 `STRIPE_PRICE_*` env vars matching the actual Stripe price IDs (a mismatch would verify the signature but silently skip the plan update). Verify `request.rawBody` populates in the Fly runtime during that test.

**Conclusion:** billing webhook is cryptographically sound. Remaining billing risk is config (price IDs / env), not vulnerability.

## 🔐 Security Remediation Sprint — ✅ Completed June 6, 2026

> Full plan with code snippets: **`SECURITY-REMEDIATION.md`**  
> All 15 findings fixed. API typechecks clean. 71/71 tests pass.

### 7 Production Blockers — ALL FIXED ✅

| ID | Status | Sev | Finding | Fix applied |

## 🐛 Known Issues & Fixes

| ID | Status | Severity | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BUG-2 | ✅ Fixed (Jun 8) | High | **Advanced targeting + Smart Product Match saved but had no runtime effect.** (a) `enableSmartAffiliate` — snippet read it off `campaign.triggers` (the normalized trigger ARRAY from the edge) so it was always `undefined`; detection never ran. (b) `pageTargetingRules` (multi-rule page-targeting builder) — editors wrote only the single legacy `pageTargeting` to the targeting table; the rule array lived only in `config.uiTriggers` and was never enforced. (c) Wizard's advanced save omitted `uiTriggers`/`schedule`, so reopening a wizard-saved campaign in the designer reset those fields. All round-tripped fine in the editor, masking the gap. | Snippet now reads `enableSmartAffiliate` from `design.uiTriggers`; both editors map each `pageTargetingRule` to a real `url_contains`/`url_exact`/`url_regex` targeting row (supersedes the legacy single field); wizard now writes `uiTriggers`+`schedule`. Commit `9bbc93c`. Verified typecheck/lint/snippet 26/26, bundle 9.71 KB. |
| BUG-1 | ✅ Fixed + live (Jun 8) | High | **WordPress plugin unactivatable** — the `scrollpop-wp.zip` on R2 was built on Windows with **backslash** path separators (`scrollpop\scrollpop.php`). WordPress (Linux/ZIP-spec, forward-slash only) can't read them as a folder, so upload resolves to `scrollpop-wp/scrollpop/scrollpop.php` and activation fails with **"Plugin file does not exist."** Observed on brewers-cafe.jp Jun 7. PHP code was correct — packaging defect only. | Rebuilt the zip with forward-slash entries under a single `scrollpop/` root via new `build-zip.py` (verifies separators); added `package` npm script + README warning (commit `c07dcf0`). Corrected zip **re-uploaded to R2 and verified live** (OPS-WP1, Jun 8). **Per-site action** on any site that installed the broken zip: delete the stale `wp-content/plugins/scrollpop-wp/` folder via FTP, then reinstall the corrected zip. |
