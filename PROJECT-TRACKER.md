## Quick Status

| Category | Total | Done | Remaining | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0 Launch blockers | 5 | 4 | 1 | P0-2 Stripe keys — ops only |
| P1 High priority | 18 | 17 | 1 | P1-14 Shopify App Store — deferred by owner |
| P2 Medium priority | 19 | 18 | 1 | P2-18 custom domain — ops only |
| P3 Low priority | 12 | 10 | 2 | P3-3 R2 domain + P3-5 marketing site — ops only |
| **Total** | **54** | **49 code ✅** | **5 ops** | All code done. 4 ops-only tasks + 1 deferred (P1-14) remain. |

> **Code status: 100% complete.** Every tracker item that required writing code has been built, tested, and reviewed (including a full multi-angle security code review on June 7 — see below). The remaining items are pure ops tasks (set Stripe env vars, configure DNS, deploy static site, re-upload the corrected WP plugin zip — see OPS-WP1 / BUG-1) and the owner-deferred Shopify App Store submission. Dormant integration keys (Sentry, PostHog, Resend) are now **activated**.
>
> **The app is ready to go live — the only thing standing between now and revenue is the Stripe ops config (P0-2), which the owner is handling.**

## P0 — Launch Blockers

Nothing ships without these.

| # | Status | Category | Item | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0-1 | ✅ | Bug | **Stripe webhook rawBody bug** — `JSON.stringify(request.body)` used for signature verification instead of raw bytes. | `webhooks.ts:227` | Registered `@fastify/rawbody`. Using `request.rawBody` in both handlers. |
| P0-2 | ⬜ | Config | **Stripe billing not activated** — `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and 4 price IDs not set. No revenue possible. | Render env vars | Code is complete. Set keys in Render, run one end-to-end checkout test, verify webhook fires. ~3 hours ops work. |
| P0-3 | ✅ | Feature | **No email lead storage** — Popup form submissions not persisted. No dashboard UI. | `schema.ts` | `leads` table, `/api/v1/leads`, Leads page with CSV export + GDPR delete. |
| P0-4 | ✅ | Bug | **A/B testing passthrough deceives users** — Live UI slider did nothing. | `snippet/main.ts` | Real weighted sticky allocation, dashboard A/B panel, per-variant analytics. |
| P0-5 | ✅ | Bug | **Campaign activate/pause does not bust KV cache** — Popups kept serving after pause. | `campaigns.ts` | `purgeSiteConfigCache()` called on activate/pause/delete. |

## P1 — High Priority

### Security

| # | Status | Category | Item | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1-1 | ✅ | Security | **Cross-tenant event injection** | `index.ts:474` | pageUrl origin validated against site domain before counting. |
| P1-2 | ✅ | Security | **Stripe checkout open redirect** | `billing.ts:63` | successUrl/cancelUrl allowlisted to dashboard origins + CF Pages preview pattern. |
| P1-3 | ✅ | Security | **Distributed bot view quota exhaustion** | `index.ts:480` | Impression's pageUrl origin must match site's registered domain. |

### Performance

| # | Status | Category | Item | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1-4 | ✅ | Performance | **N+1 in production config route** — 40 DB round trips for a 10-campaign site. | `internal.ts:114` | 4 batched `inArray` queries, identical to the local /c/ route pattern. |
| P1-5 | ✅ | Performance | **No connection pool size limit** — Already implemented: `max:10`. | `db/client.ts` | Done. Audit finding was stale. |
| P1-6 | ✅ | Performance | **`campaignMetaCache` thundering herd** — Full clear on 5,000 entries. | `index.ts:416` | Oldest-entry LRU eviction (never clears the whole map). |

### Features vs. Promolayer

| # | Status | Category | Item | Promolayer | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1-7 | ✅ | Feature | **Email lead capture UI** — Leads page with filter, pagination, CSV export, GDPR delete. | ✅ native | Done. Optional later: free-text email search. |
| P1-8 | ✅ | Feature | **Klaviyo integration** | `lib/esp.ts`, `routes/integrations.ts` | `GET/PUT /integrations`, `POST /integrations/test`. Klaviyo v3 `profile-subscription-bulk-create-jobs` endpoint. API keys stored server-side, masked on reads. Per-campaign opt-in via `GET/PUT /campaigns/:id/esp-config`. |
| P1-9 | ✅ | Feature | **Mailchimp integration** | `lib/esp.ts`, `routes/integrations.ts` | Same route as Klaviyo. Mailchimp Marketing API v3. Server prefix auto-detected from API key. `status: subscribed`. |
| P1-10 | ✅ | Feature | **Real A/B testing** — Weighted sticky per-visitor allocation, dashboard A/B panel, per-variant results. | ✅ A/B/N multivariate | Done. Optional: formal p-value significance test. |
| P1-11 | ✅ | Feature | **Countdown timers** — Absent from all popup types. | ✅ native | `countdown` element, ISO datetime or seconds-remaining, live tick after Shadow DOM mount. |
| P1-12 | ✅ | Feature | **Gamified popups (spin-to-win)** — Lazy-loaded `spin.js` (2.5 KB gzipped). Canvas wheel, weighted prizes, coupon clipboard. Wizard type picker, wheel config + live SVG preview in CampaignDetail. | ✅ 300% more submissions | Done. Optional: A/B test spin vs standard. |
| P1-13 | ✅ | Feature | **Shopify App Embed Block** — Code-complete. | ✅ App Store | Deploy via `npx shopify app deploy` (ops step). |
| P1-14 | ⬜ | Feature | **Shopify App Store submission** — 4.9★ Promolayer listing is the main inbound channel. | ✅ 4.9★ 61 reviews | Excluded from current sprint per owner decision. Requires P1-13 first. |
| P1-15 | ✅ | UX | **New user onboarding** — Blank dashboard, no empty-state CTAs. | ✅ implied | 4-step checklist (connect site → install snippet → create campaign → launch). Auto-hides when done. |
| P1-16 | ✅ | UX | **Billing upgrade throws 500** — `STRIPE_PRICE_*` not set. | `billing.ts:54` | Graceful "Billing not yet available" toast instead of 500. Resolves automatically once P0-2 is done. |
| P1-17 | ✅ | Security | **Incomplete ReDoS protection** — Alternation-based patterns not caught. | `sanitize.ts:93` | Hardened vs alternation + bounded repetition + non-compiling patterns. +12 tests. |
| P1-18 | ✅ | Debt | **No API route integration tests** | `apps/api` | 19 Vitest tests: event validation, IDOR isolation, Zod guards, webhook sig, billing URL allowlist, origin injection defence. All passing. |

## P2 — Medium Priority

### Security

| # | Status | Category | Item | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P2-1 | ✅ | Security | **No CSP header on API responses** | `index.ts:104` | `default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'none'` on all responses. |
| P2-2 | ✅ | Security | **Internal secret IP spoofing** | `index.ts:397` | Policy: quarterly rotation in CONTRIBUTING. Code already gated correctly. |
| P2-3 | ✅ | Security | **Client-controlled country field** | `index.ts:495` | country only trusted from Worker (proven by INTERNAL_SECRET header). |
| P2-4 | ✅ | Security | **No audit log for admin operations** | `admin.ts` | `admin_audit_log` table, migration 0007 + RLS + boot self-heal. |
| P2-5 | ✅ | Security | **Shopify tokens plaintext** — Already AES-256-GCM encrypted via `token-crypto.ts`. Audit was stale. | `token-crypto.ts` | Done. Requires `SHOPIFY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` on Render. |
| P2-6 | ✅ | Security | **Admin sync 500-user cap** — Duplicate of P3-8. | `admin.ts` | Fixed in security sprint. |

### Performance

| # | Status | Category | Item | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P2-7 | ✅ | Performance | **No `tenantId` index in TimescaleDB partitions** | `analytics.ts` | `events(tenant_id, ts DESC)` index, migration 0008. |
| P2-8 | ✅ | Performance | **Admin tenant list N+1** — 2 queries per row. | `admin.ts:95` | Single JOIN replacing per-row queries. |
| P2-9 | ✅ | Performance | **In-process purge job latency spikes** | `db/purge-deleted.ts` | Bounded 100 entities/pass, jittered start, split statements, backstopped by 30s timeout. |
| P2-10 | ✅ | Performance | **Campaign export 100K rows in-memory** | `campaigns.ts:236` | Cursor-paginated `Readable` stream, 500-row batches via `lt(events.ts, cursor)`. |
| P2-11 | ✅ | Performance | **No query timeouts on Drizzle** | `db/client.ts` | `statement_timeout: 30000` on the postgres client. |

### Features vs. Promolayer

| # | Status | Category | Item | Promolayer | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P2-12 | ✅ | Feature | **Coupon code auto-generation** — `coupons` table (migration 0011), bulk generate with prefix/discount/expiry, dashboard UI in CampaignDetail. | ✅ auto-gen | Done. |
| P2-13 | ✅ | Feature | **Email auto-responders** — `auto_responder` jsonb on campaigns, GET/PUT API, fires Resend on `email_capture`. | ✅ paid plans | Done. Dashboard config UI in CampaignDetail settings. |
| P2-14 | ✅ | Feature | **Zapier / outbound webhook** — Per-campaign outbound webhook delivery. | `outbound-webhook.ts` | `GET/PUT /campaigns/:id/webhook`. HMAC-SHA256 signed. Fires on `email_capture`, `conversion`, `click`, `dismiss`. Configurable event list. 5s timeout. Secret preserved across updates. `ensure-webhooks.ts` (migration 0012). |
| P2-15 | ✅ | UX | **Journeys + Experiments pages broken** | N/A | Honest "coming soon" screens. Experiments links to the live A/B panel. |
| P2-16 | ✅ | UX | **Agency multi-tenant limitation** | N/A | Documented in Settings → Team tab. Per-client workspace isolation is v2. |
| P2-17 | ✅ | Feature | **Team invitations UI** | ❓ | Settings → Team tab: member list, pending invites with revoke, invite form via Clerk `organization.inviteMember()`. |
| P2-18 | ⬜ | Infra | **`api.scrollpop.online` custom domain** — API served from `scroll-pop.onrender.com`. | N/A | Cloudflare DNS CNAME → Render. 30-minute ops task. Not blocking launch. |
| P2-19 | ✅ | Security | **No rate limit on admin routes** | `admin.ts` | 30/min on all `/api/v1/admin/*`. |

---

## P3 — Low Priority

| # | Status | Category | Item | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P3-1 | ✅ | Debt | **`any` types in activate/pause handlers** | `campaigns.ts` | Typed with `FastifyRequest<{ Params: { id: string } }>` + `FastifyReply`. |
| P3-2 | ✅ | Debt | **ESLint warnings in dashboard** | Dashboard-wide | 442 → 401 → **0 warnings**. Full proper typing pass: all `any` replaced with interfaces/`unknown`, unused vars removed, hooks deps fixed, no-useless-escape corrected. |
| P3-3 | ⬜ | Security | **R2 bucket on rate-limited r2.dev URL** — Not production-grade per Cloudflare docs. | `Sites.tsx:195` | **Ops:** Cloudflare Dashboard → R2 → `scrollpop-assets` → Settings → Custom Domain → `cdn.scrollpop.online`. Also fixes P2-18 partial. 30-min ops task. |
| P3-4 | ✅ | Security | **No session revocation** — Compromised JWT stays valid until expiry. | `webhooks.ts`, `me.ts` | `revokeAllUserSessions()` added; called on `user.deleted` webhook. `DELETE /api/v1/me` endpoint revokes sessions before DB cleanup. |
| P3-5 | ⬜ | Feature | **`scrollpop.online` marketing site** — No inbound discovery for non-Shopify operators. | ✅ Promolayer | **Ops:** `cd site-plan && pnpm build`, then `npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name scrollpop-marketing`. First deploy will prompt to create the project. `site-plan/` is a full Vite app ready to deploy. |
| P3-6 | ✅ | Infra | **Pre-deploy runbook entry** | `MASTER.md §27` | Diagnosis, manual migration, rollback via `.down.sql`, drizzle-kit push warning. |
| P3-7 | ✅ | Scale | **`resolveCampaignMeta` cache is instance-local** — Cold cache on 2+ Render instances. | `index.ts` | Redis hash `sp_campaign_meta:{id}` as L2 (300s TTL). In-process Map stays as L1. Falls through to DB on Redis error. |
| P3-8 | ✅ | Scale | **Admin Clerk sync not paginated** | `admin.ts:178` | Paginated with Clerk cursor. |
| P3-9 | ✅ | Feature | **Coupon validation on `/e` ingest** | `index.ts` | Validates code exists, not expired, within max uses; atomically increments `uses`. |
| P3-10 | ✅ | Feature | **Mobile-specific trigger overrides** — No per-device scroll %/dwell thresholds. | Promolayer marketing | `mobileOverrides: { pct?, seconds? }` added to `scroll_pct`, `dwell_time`, `inactivity` in shared schema. Snippet applies overrides via `effectiveParams()` on mobile (`maxTouchPoints > 0`). |
| P3-11 | ✅ | Debt | **`ensure-*.ts` scripts run on every cold start** — Adds latency to every Render spin-up. | `index.ts` | Redis key `sp_schema_v13` with 24h TTL; warm restarts skip the idempotent schema ensures. Bump `SCHEMA_VERSION` when adding a new ensure-* call. **Note (CR-02):** `ensureEventPartitions()` is deliberately excluded from the skip and runs every boot — partition creation is time-sensitive and must never be gated by a version flag. |
| P3-12 | ✅ | Debt | **Conversion milestone counter starts from feature launch** — Historical conversions not counted. | `index.ts` | On first `incr` (result = 1), backfills `sp_conv:{tenantId}` from DB `count(*)` of historical conversion events. |

---

## Won't Build

| Item | Reason |
|---|---|
| Back-button capture | Google spam policy violation from Jun 15, 2026. Would cause de-indexing of customer sites. |
| SAML SSO | No enterprise customers. V3 at earliest. |
| Native iOS/Android SDKs | No demand signal. |
| ClickHouse migration | Only justified at >50M events/month. |
| Real-time social proof popups | Requires pub/sub infra. Complexity not justified now. |
| AI copy generation | Nice-to-have. Not a conversion driver at this stage. |
| Wix native app | Low ROI. Wix has tiny market share vs Shopify/WordPress. |
| Full white-labelling | V3. No enterprise customers. |

## Sprint Suggestions — UPDATED June 7

> **All code sprints are complete.** Sprints 1–4 (original audit), Sprint A (email integration), and Sprint B (outbound webhooks) are shipped. Only ops sprints (C, D) and the owner-deferred App Store submission remain.

### Immediate — Revenue Gate (~3 hours, ops only) — ⬜ owner handling

**P0-2 only.** Set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, 4 `STRIPE_PRICE_*` IDs in Render. Run one end-to-end test: checkout → Stripe test webhook → plan update → verify dashboard reflects new plan. That's it. The app is then live and can charge customers.

### ✅ Sprint A — Email Integration — COMPLETED

**P1-8 + P1-9.** Klaviyo and Mailchimp shipped: `lib/esp.ts` adapters + `GET/PUT/POST /integrations` + per-campaign opt-in via `/campaigns/:id/esp-config`. Hardened June 7 (true opt-in, no credential/PII leakage — CR-03, CR-05). Keys stored server-side, masked on reads.

### ✅ Sprint B — Outbound Webhooks — COMPLETED

**P2-14.** Per-campaign outbound webhook (`GET/PUT /campaigns/:id/webhook`), HMAC-SHA256 signed, fires on `email_capture`/`conversion`/`click`/`dismiss`. Hardened June 7 (all-record SSRF guard, no-clobber partial updates, sanitized-field precedence — CR-04, CR-06, CR-07).

### Sprint C — Domain & CDN (2 hours, ops) — ⬜

**P2-18 + P3-3.** Add `api.scrollpop.online` CNAME in Cloudflare (30 min). Add `cdn.scrollpop.online` custom domain to the R2 bucket (30 min). Update `API_BASE_URL` and `SNIPPET_CDN_URL` references. Removes Render vendor lock-in from public URLs and upgrades the snippet CDN from the rate-limited r2.dev domain.

### Sprint D — Marketing Site (2–3 days, design + code) — ⬜

**P3-5.** Deploy `site-plan/` as a Cloudflare Pages project. Without this, non-Shopify operators have no way to find ScrollPop through organic channels. Not a technical challenge — content and deployment.

### Ongoing / Low-Urgency

**P3-2** ✅ Done — 0 ESLint warnings + 0 TS errors.  
**P3-4** ✅ Done — session revocation on user delete + `DELETE /me`.  
**P3-7** Redis campaign meta cache — only matters if Render scales to 2+ instances.  
**P3-10** ✅ Done — mobile trigger overrides shipped.  
**P3-11** ensure-* startup overhead — convert to proper migrations in next schema sprint.  
**P3-12** Milestone backfill — one-time script, run manually when needed.  

---

## Go-Live Timeline (excluding Stripe keys and Shopify App Store)

| Milestone | Work | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Soft launch — first paying customer possible** | Configure Stripe in Render (~3 hrs ops). App is code-complete. | ⬜ Owner handling (the only launch blocker) |
| **Growth launch — email capture useful for Shopify operators** | Klaviyo + Mailchimp adapters (P1-8 + P1-9) | ✅ Shipped + hardened |
| **Full launch — Zapier + clean URLs** | Outbound webhooks (P2-14) ✅ · domain ops (P2-18/P3-3) ⬜ | 🔄 Code done; domain ops remain |
| **Discovery launch — inbound traffic possible** | P3-5 marketing site live | ⬜ Ops (deploy `site-plan/`) |

**The Stripe keys are the only thing between now and revenue.** Every code item — every CTO audit blocker, every security finding (SR-01→15 + CR-01→08), email integrations, outbound webhooks, and the full type/lint cleanup — is complete, tested, and reviewed. Launch readiness: 61 → 84 → 92 → **94/100**. The app is ready to go live; what remains is pure ops (Stripe env vars, DNS/CDN domains, static-site deploy) plus the owner-deferred Shopify App Store submission.

*Last updated: June 7, 2026. Tracker fully reconciled — P3-2 complete, June 7 security code review (CR-01→08) recorded, dependency map + sprints + timeline corrected, dormant keys marked active. This file is the single source of truth; MASTER.md links here rather than duplicating status.*

---

## ✅ P3-2 — Dashboard Type/Lint Cleanup — COMPLETED June 7, 2026

> **Done.** `apps/dashboard`: **0 ESLint warnings** and **0 TypeScript errors** under full strict mode (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `strict`).

All 6 complex designer/wizard files that previously blocked completion are fixed with proper typed interfaces and narrowed casts (no blanket `any`):

| File | Resolution |
|---|---|
| `campaign-designer/Canvas.tsx` | framer-motion `Variants` type imported from `motion/react`; element access narrowed |
| `campaign-designer/InteractivePreview.tsx` | `extraProps?.href`/`placeholder` cast to `string \| undefined`; render casts via `Record<string,unknown>` |
| `campaign-designer/SidebarLeft.tsx` | callback props typed `unknown`; `CampaignTriggers` fields used directly |
| `campaign-wizard/DesignControls.tsx` | `DraftBuilderElement` imported; `updateBlock` takes `Partial<DraftBuilderElement>` |
| `campaign-wizard/LivePreview.tsx` | `LiveBlock`/`WheelSlice` interfaces; `block.props` accesses cast at use sites |
| `campaign-wizard/ActionsBuilder.tsx` | literal-union casts (avoids `undefined` under `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`) |

Plus `DraftBuilderElement` exported from `types/campaign.ts` and `lib/templates.ts` typed off it. Verified: `pnpm -r typecheck` clean, `pnpm -r lint` clean. Shipped across commits `497224c`, `f38ffbd`.

## 🔎 Security Code Review — ✅ Completed June 7, 2026

> Full multi-angle review (line-by-line + removed-behavior + cross-file + cleanup) of the whole platform. **No backdoors / auth bypasses found.** 8 real findings confirmed and fixed in commit `3062745`. Verified: snippet 26/26, API 71/71, typecheck + lint clean, bundle 9.68 KB.

| ID | Sev | Finding | Fix applied |
|---|---|---|---|
| CR-01 | 🔴 Critical | **`cssFont` XSS** — allowlist included `"`, letting a tenant font-family break out of the `style="…"` attribute (contradicted its own doc) | Removed `"` from the allowlist; added regression test (`sanitize.test.ts`) |
| CR-02 | 🟠 High | **Month-rollover analytics loss** — `ensureEventPartitions()` was gated behind the 24h schema-skip flag; a warm restart could skip creating next month's partition → inserts silently dropped | Runs on every boot now, ungated (time-sensitive ≠ version-sensitive) |
| CR-03 | 🟠 High | **Cross-campaign PII leak** — ESP dispatch was opt-*out* (`!== false`), so default `{}` synced every campaign's leads into a tenant's globally-enabled ESP | Flipped to opt-*in* (`=== true`); matches the per-campaign opt-in contract |
| CR-04 | 🟠 High | **Spoofed webhook payloads** — raw client `meta` spread *after* sanitized fields, letting forged `/e` events override email/pageUrl/revenueCents in operator deliveries | Spread `...md4` first so server-sanitized values win |
| CR-05 | 🟠 High | **Credential/PII in logs & responses** — ESP adapters returned/logged the provider's raw error body (can echo the API key) | Report HTTP status only; never the body |
| CR-06 | 🟡 Medium | **Webhook config clobber** — partial PUT replaced the whole `outboundWebhook` column, wiping `url`/`events` | Merge onto previous config; `events` made optional |
| CR-07 | 🟡 Medium | **SSRF gap** — SSRF guard checked only the first DNS record | Resolve all addresses (`{all:true}`), reject if any private; IPv6 + mapped-IPv4 coverage (strengthens SR-01) |
| CR-08 | 🟡 Medium | **Fail-open flood gate** — per-IP impression cap failed fully open when Redis was down → forged quota burn | Per-instance in-memory fallback gate |

**Residual (accepted, not a code gap):** the event-origin check still fails open for sites with no configured domain (donation/"other" platforms legitimately have none); the in-memory flood gate covers the Redis-down risk. Tracked here for transparency.

**Tooling added:** `.githooks/pre-commit` (rebuilds + re-stages `apps/worker/src/p.txt` whenever snippet source changes, so the served bundle can never drift from source) + `.gitattributes` LF enforcement, enabled via `core.hooksPath` on `pnpm install`.

## 🧪 Billing Webhook Verification — Real-SDK Dry-Run — ✅ June 7, 2026

> The main suite mocked the `stripe` module, so the actual signature-verification path had never been exercised. New test `apps/api/src/stripe-webhook.test.ts` runs the **real** Stripe SDK. Commit `b65a23b`.

| # | Test | Result | Proves |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Valid signature over a **non-canonical (whitespace) raw payload** | ✅ 200 `received:true` | `request.rawBody` is captured + used — the `JSON.stringify(request.body)` fallback would fail on these bytes (closes the P0-1 footgun concern) |
| 2 | Tampered body, original signature | ✅ 400 `INVALID_SIGNATURE` | Forged/modified events rejected |
| 3 | Signature signed with wrong secret | ✅ 400 `INVALID_SIGNATURE` | Only the real `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` verifies |
| 4 | Missing `stripe-signature` header | ✅ 400 `INVALID_SIGNATURE` | No unsigned events accepted |

**API suite now 75/75** (was 71). Typecheck clean.

**Scope of this proof:** it validates cryptographic signature verification + forgery resistance in isolation with a test secret. It does **not** exercise the end-to-end money flow (real checkout → `checkout.session.completed`/`customer.subscription.created` → price-ID→plan mapping → tenant row update → cache bust). That still needs the **one live test charge** under P0-2, and depends on the 4 `STRIPE_PRICE_*` env vars matching the actual Stripe price IDs (a mismatch would verify the signature but silently skip the plan update). Verify `request.rawBody` populates in the Render runtime during that test.

**Conclusion:** billing webhook is cryptographically sound. Remaining billing risk is config (price IDs / env), not vulnerability.

## 🔐 Security Remediation Sprint — ✅ Completed June 6, 2026

> Full plan with code snippets: **`SECURITY-REMEDIATION.md`**  
> All 15 findings fixed. API typechecks clean. 71/71 tests pass.

### 7 Production Blockers — ALL FIXED ✅

| ID | Status | Sev | Finding | Fix applied |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SR-01 | ✅ | 🔴 Critical | **SSRF** outbound webhook | Private-IP blocklist + `redirect:'error'` + DNS-rebind-safe fire-time re-check |
| SR-02 | ✅ | 🟠 High | **False test** `/integrations/test` always `ok:true` | Adapters return `EspSyncResult`; test endpoint inspects result |
| SR-03 | ✅ | 🟠 High | **Sole-owner orphan** `DELETE /me` | 409 guard before any DB mutation |
| SR-04 | ✅ | 🟠 High | **Dirty-delete window** DB before Clerk | Reversed: Clerk delete first, DB only on success |
| SR-05 | ✅ | 🟡 Medium | **Mailchimp serverPrefix injection** | `^[a-z]{2}\d{1,2}$` validated before URL construction |
| SR-06 | ✅ | 🟡 Medium | **Coupon TOCTOU** | Atomic `UPDATE … WHERE uses < maxUses RETURNING` |
| SR-07 | ✅ | 🟡 Medium | **Auto-responder XSS** | `sanitize-html` allowlist on `htmlBody` before send |

### 8 Medium + Low Findings — ALL FIXED ✅

|---|---|---|---|---|
| SR-08 | ✅ | 🟡 Medium | **Mailchimp 400 swallowed** | Only genuine "Member Exists" 400 is non-fatal |
| SR-09 | ✅ | 🟡 Medium | **No rate limit on test endpoint** | 5/min keyed per `tenantId` |

| SR-11 | ✅ | 🟢 Low | **Frequency cap key mismatch** | `_sp_fr_X` corrected to `_sp_X` |
| SR-12 | ✅ | 🟢 Low | **Redis partial hash cast** | Type guards added for `siteId` + `platform` |
| SR-13 | ✅ | 🟢 Low | **PUT /integrations silent no-op** | 404 when tenant not found |
| SR-14 | ✅ | 🟢 Low | **Empty email on phone/OAuth Clerk user** | Synthetic `@noemail.scrollpop.local` placeholder |
| SR-15 | ✅ | 🟢 Low | **Duplicated session revocation** | Shared `lib/auth.ts` helper used by both routes |

### Remaining Ops Tasks (no code needed)

## 🐛 Known Issues & Fixes

| ID | Status | Severity | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BUG-1 | 🔄 Code fixed; ops pending | High | **WordPress plugin unactivatable** — the `scrollpop-wp.zip` on R2 was built on Windows with **backslash** path separators (`scrollpop\scrollpop.php`). WordPress (Linux/ZIP-spec, forward-slash only) can't read them as a folder, so upload resolves to `scrollpop-wp/scrollpop/scrollpop.php` and activation fails with **"Plugin file does not exist."** Observed on brewers-cafe.jp Jun 7. PHP code was correct — packaging defect only. | Rebuilt the zip with forward-slash entries under a single `scrollpop/` root via new `build-zip.py` (verifies separators); added `package` npm script + README warning (commit `c07dcf0`). **Pending ops:** re-upload to R2 (OPS-WP1) + on the affected site, delete the stale `wp-content/plugins/scrollpop-wp/` folder via FTP before reinstalling the corrected zip. |
